# PIR-Sensor-Module
The Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensor module detects IR emitting
objects within a certain range. The module consists of:
1. RE200b PIR sensor
2. Resistors
3. Capacitors
4. Operational amplifiers
5. Potentiometers
6. Switches
7. Buzzer and/or lamp. 

The characteristics
of the module heavily depends on the type of the IR
sensor chosen for the project i.e. whether the module can detect
both objects in motion and motionless objects in the field
of detection.
The range of the detection can be increased up to 5m, with
increments of 1m. The output of the module is given by the
buzzer and/or lamp.

The PIR sensor module has a variety of applications. For
example, the module can be used as a security device by placing
it suitably near a doorway (or passage, corridor, window,
etc.). It will detect if anyone goes through the doorway.
Also, the module can be used as an animal detection device
at night time. Especially, farmers can place some sensors
in their fields suitably, so the modules may detect if there are
animals in the field and emit bright light or give out a repelling
sound, which will scare away animals.
